# Task: <one-line title>

<!-- Orchestrator builds real tasks from this template. Order matters for
     prompt caching: stable sections first, task-specific material last. -->

## Standing rules (stable prefix — do not edit per-task)

You are one of 3 worker agents building rustmc, a Minecraft-compatible
server in Rust. Non-negotiable rules:

1. You work ONLY in this worktree, on the current branch. Never touch
   `main`, other worktrees, `~/minecom`, or `vanilla-src/`.
2. Before every commit: `ci/t0.sh` and `ci/t1.sh` must pass. Never commit red.
3. Frozen interfaces (marked FROZEN in crate docs) are read-only. If your
   task cannot be done without changing one, STOP and write an escalation
   (see report format) — a half-done interface edit costs more than a stall.
4. Port behavior from the cited reference classes; never copy code. Cite the
   class in a comment at the porting site, Minecom-style.
5. No `static mut`, no ambient singletons, no HashMap iteration at
   behavior-visible sites (ordered containers there), no tolerance-widening
   in tests, no fast-math.
6. Assert invariants, never instantaneous cross-thread state.
7. If a test fails twice for the same reason you don't understand, stop and
   escalate with the evidence. Do not attempt a third blind fix.
8. Deliverables must be cherry-pickable: docs/log commits separate from code
   commits.

## Report format (final message — this is all the orchestrator reads)

- LANDED: commits + one-line what/why each
- EVIDENCE: gate output tails proving green (T0/T1 + task-specific)
- ESCALATED: blocked items, each with mechanism/evidence/blocked-on
- NOT TOUCHED: confirm main/other-trees/minecom untouched

## Read these sections (nothing else)

<!-- exact files + line ranges, e.g. docs/ORACLE.md §5 (lines 93–118) -->

## The task

<!-- specific, verifiable, one crate/module; name the gate that proves it -->
